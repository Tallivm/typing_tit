Feelings you see are so hard to believe
All the chaos I have in my heart
Devils I make and the love can't relate
All the solace inside tears me up

Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now

Weaving deceits is so easy for me
'Cause the loathing I've had from the start
Evil disease, all the hatred it breeds
As I'm down on my knees, torn apart

Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now

Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to end my life
Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to get out alive

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now5Embed
